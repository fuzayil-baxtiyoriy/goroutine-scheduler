# Goroutine Scheduler ðŸš¦

This project implements a simple job scheduler in Go using goroutines, simulating the core logic of operating system schedulers (e.g., Round-Robin). Each job is run concurrently with a fixed time slot, helping you understand how context switching and cooperative scheduling can be modeled in Go.

## Features
- âœ… Round-robin scheduling
- âœ… Time-slice control
- ðŸ§© Easily extendable to priority or preemptive scheduling

## Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fuzayil-baxtiyoriy/goroutine-scheduler.git
cd goroutine-scheduler

# Run the project
go run main.go
```

## File Structure
```
main.go               # Entry point
scheduler/
  â”œâ”€â”€ job.go          # Job definition
  â””â”€â”€ scheduler.go    # Core scheduler logic
go.mod               # Go module file
```

## Example Output
```
Starting Round-Robin Scheduler...
Running job #1
Executing work for job #1
Finished job #1
...
```

## Future Ideas
## Future Ideas
- [ ] Add priority scheduling to allow high-importance jobs to run earlier
- [ ] Add preemptive scheduling using `context.Context` to simulate timeouts and interrupts
- [ ] Track job execution statistics and history (start time, end time, duration)
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed jobs
- [ ] Implement job cancellation and pausing/resuming
- [ ] CLI dashboard with [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview) to monitor job queue in real time
- [ ] Add persistent job queue using BoltDB or SQLite
- [ ] Support worker pool with configurable concurrency limits
- [ ] REST API to submit and monitor jobs
